# front-end

This is the front-end of the application.

## How to use

### Install

To install the dependencies, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm ci
```

### Production Build

To generate the production build, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Development

Ensure the dependencies are installed (see above) and the `back-end` is running with its basic "worlds" setup (docker recommended).

Copy the `.example.env.local` file to `.env.local` and edit it to match your local backend instance.

Then, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And you're done! See the app running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To lint the code, run the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This also checks for `prettier` formatting. To explicitly format the code with `prettier`, run the following command:

```bash
npm run format
```

It's recommended to enable the `prettier` plugin in VS Code to automatically format the code when you save it. See [this page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) or [this one](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/code-formatting-with-prettier-in-visual-studio-code) for more information.

## Notes

Node.js is required (includes npm). You can download it here: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). LTS will work.
